**Technology Used:** React.js, Express, Node, MongoDB 

**Features:** The project currently features pages to create an account, login, deposit, withdraw and to check balances. In the future, I would like to reauthenticate so that deposit, withdraw and balance pages are hidden until a user successfully logs in.
